**From Cells to Insights: A Hands-On Guide to Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis**



**March 24th 2025**

**Sam Storey**


Modules will be presented in the following order:
1. Processing: How to process scRNAseq data with Seurat
2. Annotation, DE and subsetting
3. Advanced data visualization


Instructions:

1.	[Please go to this link]([url](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)) and follow the instructions to download **BOTH R and RStudio**. Even if you already have both, you can (and probably should) use the exact same instructions to update both programs.

You can also clone the repository if you are familiar with Git.



5. Right click scRNAseq_processing.R and select 'Open With' -> 'RStudio'

6. In RStudio, select 'File' -> 'New Project', select 'Existing Directory'. Ensure the path is to the scRNAseq_workshop-main folder you downloaded from github. Select 'Create Project'.


Great, you're good to go and ready for the workshop.
